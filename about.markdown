Brandon Keele is currently a student at BYU studying statistics, data science, and machine learning. He has plans to graduate in April 2025 and take a deep dive into the exciting world of data.

Brandon is a proud husband and a father to a beautiful little girl. He is an avid fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers and is grateful every time that baseball season rolls around.
