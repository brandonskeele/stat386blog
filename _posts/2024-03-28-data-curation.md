## Introduction

I am a longtime baseball fan. I love following along with the players and teams to see how they are doing and to see which contracts pan out and which ones don't. And it's only fitting that today (as of writing this) is Opening Day for the new season.

In preparation for all of the exciting things that a new season is bound to bring, I wanted to know what the current leaderboard looks like for home-runs. Not only that, but I wanted to potentially get a few additional insights into what causes certain players to hit so many while others just never seem to be able to get the ball past the outfield wall.

Here we will discuss the procedures I used to collect this data, as well as some additional potential that exists to expand this project in the future.
